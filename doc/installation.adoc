== Adding external plugins
ProjectForge supports external 3rd party plugins:
1. Place your jars e. g. in `/home/kai/ProjectForge/plugins`
2. Tell ProjectForge where it is. You may have to options:
   a. Run ProjectForge from command line with option `-Dloader.home=/home/kai/ProjectForge`, or
   b. Set the environment variable before starting ProjectForge: `export LOADER_HOME=/home/kai/ProjectForge`.
3. Start ProjectForge and activate the plugin as admin in the ProjectForge's web app under menu Admin->plugins.
4. Restart ProjectForge.

== Backups
=== JCR
Attachments will be handled through the built-in JCR module. The backups are placed in `ProjectForge/backup`, the daily backups will
purged after 30 days keeping each first monthly backup.

=== DB backup
You may configure a purge job in `projectforge.properties`:
```
### If purgeBackupDir is given and exists, ProjectForge will purge daily backups older than 30 days keeping each first monthly backup.
### The filenames must contain the date in ISO format (...yyyy-MM-dd....).
# This is the backup dir to look for:
projectforge.cron.purgeBackupDir=/home/projectforge/backup
# You may optional specify the prefix of the backup files (if not given, all files containing a date in its filename will be processed):
projectforge.cron.purgeBackupFilesPrefix=projectforge_
```
Your daily data base backups should contain the date of backup in ISO format in its file name.
Daily backups (not monthly) will be deleted after 30 days.
Refer config file for all options: [https://github.com/micromata/projectforge/blob/develop/projectforge-business/src/main/resources/application.properties]

== Reverse Proxy Setup

The recommended way of setting up ProjectForge is to use a reverse proxy to do the SSL termination. This document focueses on using the NGINX web server software to  accomplish this.

=== Nginx
==== Prepare

All of the commands below should be run with `root` privileges.

1. Install Nginx: `$ apt-get install nginx`
2. Get an SSL certificate(use only one of the options below)
   a. Create self signed certificate: `$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/projectforge.key -out /etc/ssl/projectforge.crt`
   b. Generate an SSL certificate https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/[using Letsencrypt], note that the path in the NGINX configuration below needs to be changed when using Letsencrypt.
3. Generate secure Diffie-Hellman parameters for key exchange (this will take a long time): `$ openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096`

===== secure domain for setup through htpasswd (optional)
1. `$ apt-get install apache2-utils`
2. `$ htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd projectforge`

==== Configure Nginx

To use NGINX as a reverse proxy, it's necessary to create a configuration file. The standard path for NGINX configurations is `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`, so let's create the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectforge` with the content listed below.
If you want to use `.htaccess` to blok access to the installation, you need to remove the comment character (`#`) in front of the `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_file` parameters.
If you want to use HSTS (which makes browsers show an error page when the SSL certificate is invalid and/or nonexistent), remove the comment character (`#`) in front of the `add_header Strict-Transport-Security` parameter.

**Remeber to replace *projectforge.example.com* with the actual domain you'll run ProjectForge on!**

----

To activate the NGINX configuration, you'll need to symlink the configuration file we just created to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. This can be done by using the following command:

```bash
$ ln -sv /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectforge /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/projectforge
```

== Start ProjectForge
1. Start ProjectForge server (e.g. on `http://localhost:8080`, update the NGINX config if you use another port).
2. Follow the configuration instruction (setup wizard in console ui or as Desktop app).
3. (Re-)start Nginx:
3.1. SysVInit: `/etc/init.d/nginx restart`
3.2. SystemD: `systemctl restart nginx`
4. Navigate to ProjectForge with your browser and finalize the setup.
