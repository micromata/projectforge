== How to deploy a new release?

1. Modify `site/_changelogs` with updated release information
2. Run `DevelopmentMainForRelease.kt` main to sort all i18n resources and fix source file headers, if any.
3. Define new release variable: +
   `./build.gradle.kts: version = '8.0'`
4. `./gradlew clean build`
5. If all tests are finished successfully and the test of the ProjectForge-Application works for new and existing databases), proceed:
6. Copy executable jar file from `projectforge-application/build/libs/projectforge-application-\*.jar` to SourceForge and tag this file as default for all platforms
7. Building and pushing docker
    a. For testing docker images first, please refer `/docker/README.adoc`.
    b. `export PF_VERSION=8.0`
    c. `export DOCKER_USER=micromata`
    d. `cp projectforge-application/build/libs/projectforge-application*.jar .`
    e. `docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64
          --build-arg JAR_FILE=projectforge-application-$PF_VERSION.jar
          -t $DOCKER_USER/projectforge:$PF_VERSION
          -t $DOCKER_USER/projectforge:latest --push .`
    f. Check docker images: https://hub.docker.com/r/micromata/projectforge/tags (both should be available: arm64 and amd64)
8. Merge the release branch into the master and develop branch (Git Flow: Finish release)
9. Tag master branch with version number
10. Change to develop branch
11. Create new SNAPSHOT-Release by increasing version number: +
`./build.gradle.kts: version = '8.0.1-SNAPSHOT'`
12. Commit everything to master and develop branch and push it to Github
13. Upload the saved jar files to Github (Create release from tagged version) and SourceForge (e.g. as zip (see previous versions as example)).

Optional (if not done before):
