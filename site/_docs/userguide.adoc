== Introduction

This document includes some hints tips and best practices for the usage
of ProjectForge®. It will never contain the whole functionality of
ProjectForge® because a well-designed web application is easy to use
and self-explained by tool tips etc.

== Common concepts


=== Full-indexed search

All list views support a search field. Refer the tool tip to see which
fields of the data objects are part of the index. (see figure 1).

image::/uploads/userguide/searchfield.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 1: |Enter a free text in the search field to start a full text
query. Part of words are as well supported as logical expressions.
|===

A detailed description of the possibilities may be find on Lucene
page https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html[window=_blank].

The following table shows some common used queries.

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Expression |Function

|abc |The search result contains all objects with fields contain words
beginning with 'abc'. The search isn't case-sensitive.

|+++*+++abc+++*+++ |The search result contains all objects with fields contain words
containing 'abc'. The search isn't case-sensitive.

|meier~ |Phonetic search: Fields containing e. g. 'mayer' will also be
found as 'meier'!

|abc def |Searches for fields which contain words beginning with 'abc'
and/or 'def'.

|+abc -def |Search for fields containing words beginning with 'abc' but
not with 'def'.

|name:abc def |Search for all objects where the field 'name' contains
words beginning with 'abc' and searches for 'def' in all object fields.
|===

==== Automatical wildcards

*Hint*

____
If the search field contains only sub-string with alphanumerical
characters (including @._* and spaces) ProjectForge® appends
automatically the wildcard character '*'. For all other expressions the
entered term will be leaved untouched. Logical expressions of Lucene
(the keywords AND, OR and NOT) will also be leaved untouched).
____

[cols="1,3",]
|===
|Expression |Modification by ProjectForge

|hello |hello*

|hello ProjectForge |hello* ProjectForge*

|k.reinhard@projectforge |k.reinhard@projectforge*

|hello AND 2008-11-21 NOT hurz OR test |hello* AND 2008-11-21 NOT hurz*
OR test* +
(Expressions containing special characters such as -+, will be leaved
untouched.)

|hello AND name:hurzel |hello AND name:hurzel hello AND name:hurzel +
(no substitution because of ':'.)

|+hello and hurzel |+hello and hurzel +
(no substitution because of '+'.)
|===

If in doubt, ProjectForge® displays any substitution of the user's
input below the search field.d).

==== Search for structure elements

ProjectForge® searches also for names of ancestor structure
elements. If you search for time-sheets for 'Yellow logistics' all
time-sheets assigned to the structure element 'Yellow logistics' or
descendant structure elements will be found.

=== Quick-select

If you choose any list view for selection (e. g. structure element) and
only one entry is found by the search this entry will be selected
automatically and ProjectForge® returns to the caller page.

=== Filter for search in history of changes

Almost all list pages supports an extended filter for searching for
objects regarding the history of changes, e. g. the user wants to find
any object which was changed during the last 10 minutes etc. Click on
the plus sign at the right bottom of the search field's label to see the
opportunities.  +
All other filter criteria will also be used. (see figure 2)

image::/uploads/userguide/extendedFilter.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 2: |Through the extended search filter you may search for
objects which were changed during a given time period.
|===

_ _

=== Auto completion

For more and more fields an auto-completion is supported. After entering
2 characters a list of entries suggested by the server will be displayed
for a convenient selection. You may enter the cursor up- and down-keys
to select entries without using your mouse.  +
A double-mouse-click, if supported by the input field, will show recent
used entries or a list of all available objects.

=== Favorites / bookmarks

For sending pages of ProjectForge® as link via e-mail or for
bookmarking them in your browser, you should use the menu entry 'Show as
bookmark'. ProjectForge® offers a link including all settings of the
page (e. g. the filter settings of the list view).  +
Please do not use the displayed url in your browser because this URL
isn't valid outside your current session.

==== Favorites / bookmarks in list views

As figure 3 shows ProjectForge® offers two links in list views:

. Direct link for list view without preset of the filter parameter (the
default view is used with the recent parameters).
. Direct link for list view with preset of the filter parameters.

image::/uploads/userguide/Bookmark-list.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 3: |This figure demonstrates the bookmarking functionality of
the list views. The first link contains only a bookmark for the list
view without the preset of any parameters (the default view is used).
The second link contains a bookmark with the preset of all filter
parameters.
|===

==== Favorites / bookmarks of time-sheets

As figure 4 shows, ProjectForge® offers also two links in time-sheet
edit pages:

. Direct link for displaying an object by id.
. Direct link including parameters for calling the edit page with
pre-filled parameters. This is useful for adding new time-sheets with
pre-filled parameters.

The second link may be used for creation of new time-sheets with
templates (e. g. in JIRA or e-mails).

image::/uploads/userguide/Bookmark-edit.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 4: | Bookmarks
|===

=== Stay logged-in

On the login-screen the user may choose the 'stay-logged-in' option.

* ProjectForge® creates a browser cookie with a validity of 30 days.
* At the next login from the same browser ProjectForge® detects this
cookie, renews it and proceed the automatical login.
* If the user chooses the menu entry 'log-out' the cookie will be
deleted (if exists) and the user/passwort authentication is required
again in this browser.
* The cookie will be invalid if the user haven't used it for 30 or more
day or the user's password and/or username has been changed.
* The cooky stores the user id, the username and a code. All three
parameters are checked by ProjectForge®.
* Under 'My account' the user may renew the previous mentioned code. All
stay-logged-in-sessions in all browsers are invalid directly after
renewing this code. Please note: Any valid session isn't effected by
this action.
* The stay-logged-in option may be re-activated at any time after
entering username and password on the login-screen.

== Calendar

The calendar is one of the most important functionalities of
ProjectForge®. You may organize your time-sheets and personal events
as well as team events in a convenient way. ProjectForge® is
designed to improve the efficiency of projects and project teams from
single-person-projects up to large-sized projects.

=== Quick-time-period-selection

You may browse very fast through month and/or weeks with the following
element of ProjectForge®. (see figure 5)

image::/uploads/userguide/Zeitblaettern.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 5: |Quick-time-period selection with browse mode for months and
weeks
|===

=== Holidays

ProjectForge® support holidays and you may configure own holidays
in `config.xml.`

=== Support of different time zones

ProjectForge® supports different time-zones at once. The user may
change his time-zone if he travels through different time-zones.

=== View modes

==== Calendar views: month, week, day

==== Customizable views with fast switch

You're able to customize different filters of your calendars to show and
use. Switch the view with only two clicks. You may give your different
calendars different colors.

image::/uploads/userguide/PF-TeamCal-filters-preview.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 8: |Customize your view filters with own colors etc. You may
switch the view with only two clicks.
|===

=== Drag & drop and range-select functionality

You may create, move, resize and copy events by drag&drop and
range-select functionality. The the videos or demo system for experience
this convenient feature.

* *Download and subscription of calendars*  +
You can download or subscribe all calendars as ics files. Subscribe
ProjectForge's calendars in Google calendar, MS Outlook oder Apples
iCal.

* *Share your calendars*  +
Use ProjectForge for team calendars. How to add a new calendar.
* *Recurrence*  +
ProjectForge supports recurrence of events. You may remove or modify
single events or future events of recurrence events.

**3 access modes**

. *Full access*  +
The assigned groups and users are able to read, insert, update and
delete any event of the calendar.-
. *Read-only access*  +
The assigned groups and users are only able to read all events including
the subscription and download.
. *Minimal access*  +
The assigned groups and users are only able to read all event start and
stop times including the subscription and download. All other properties
of events such as title, notes etc. are removed and aren't visible.

image::/uploads/userguide/PF-TeamCal-Access.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 12: |You may configure the access to any calendar for groups
and/or users.
|===

* *Import new events per Drag'n drop*  +
You may import new events by simply dropping the ics files into the drop
area at the top of the calendar page.

=== Roadmap

Further planned developments are described here.

* *Attendees*  +
** *ProjectForge user's as attendees*  +
Badge with new invitations.
** *External user's as attendees*  +
. *Invitation per e-mail*  +
Send e-mail with an ics attachment, a summary and a link to accept/deny
and comment an invitation.
. *User's e-mail as return-to-address*  +
The return-to-address will be the user's e-mail address, so any response
of invitation is sent to the user and has to be handled by the user.
. *ProjectForge's e-mail as return-to-address*  +
The return-to-address will be ProjectForge's e-mail address, so any
response of invitations is parsed by ProjectForge and the event is
updated.
** *Update events and multi event import*  +
Currently ics files can be dropped as files into ProjectForge only if
the contain only a single event which isn't already present. Later an
update dialog with differences to accept/deny will be shown and a
multi-import should be supported.
* *More complex recurrence pattern*
* *Subscription of external calendars in ProjectForge*  +
Starting with icloud. An user is able to share his icloud calendars via
ProjectForge.

== Address book

=== Reverse search of phone numbers

ProjectForge® adds every phone number without any special characters
and white spaces to the search index. You may enter any sub string of
the phone number to find the address connected to this phone number (if
exist).

**Hint**

____
Sometimes you may omit the country prefix of the phone number to find
the address.
____

=== Personal favorites

You may import addresses of the list view in your personal address book
(e. g. Apple contacts) and synchronize the addresses with your mobile
device. The export format is VCard (vcf) for addresses and a csv format
for phone numbers (e. g. for your telephony system).  +
Your favorite addresses will be highlighted in the list view.

==== Export of vcards

You may choose the check-box 'Favorite' beside the form of address in
the edit view of an address for marking the whole address as favorite
(see figure 13). Click the button 'Export vCards' for downloading all
marked addresses. You may choose single phone number for exporting them
in csv format by clicking the check-box '*' right after the desired
phone number.

**Hint**

____
Please use UTF-8 as encoding in your address book software!
____

image::/uploads/userguide/AddressEdit-Favorites.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 13: |This figure demonstrates the possibility to mark addresses
or phone numbers as favorites.
|===

===== Hint for Apple contacts

Multiple exports of addresses may result in multiple note entries.
Please use the following Apple script for removing such multiple note
entries:

[source,linenums,applescript]
----
tell application "Address Book"
repeat with thisPerson in every person
if (exists (note of thisPerson)) and ((note of thisPerson) contains "CLASS: WORK") then
log "Name: " & (name of thisPerson)
delete note of thisPerson
end if
end repeat
save
end tell
----

. You may excecute this script directly in your Apple-Script editor.
(The result 'missing value' is expected.)
. Afterwards you should import the ProjectForge® download (vCard).

==== Export of personal list of telephone numbers

You may export telephone numbers of addresses (marked in the address
edit page by clicking the check-box '*', refer
fig. 13).
You may import phone numbers to your mobile device or system telephone
(e. g. SNOM telephone) if vCard isn't supported.  +
Via the button 'Export phone list' all' all marked phone numbers will be
exported with ISO-8859 encoding as csv file. ProjectForge® extends
the names of the contacts automatically with "mobile" or "private", if the
number is not the business phone number.



==== Personal list of phone numbers for your Snom telephone

The exported list may be uploaded directly via the web site of the
desired Snom telephone. The following figures 14 and 15 demonstrate the
procedure of such an import.

**Hint**

____
Any previous imported phone number will be overwritten (no multiple
entries are expected).
____

=== Export of the list of addresses

You may export the current displayed list of addresses for usage with
LibreOffice or MS Excel. For reasons of data-protection only the user's
favorite addresses will be exported. Members of the
groups `PF_Finance` or `PF_Marketing` are able to download all address
for using them for marketing events etc.

**Hint**

____
The first address of each row is the mailing address. It's the postal
address if exist, otherwise the business address.
____

=== Animation of phone number / zoom

Figure 16 shows the Mouse-over-functionality, if the mouse cursor is
positioned over a phone number. You may dial the number with your phone
now.

image::/uploads/userguide/AddressList-NumberZoom.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 16: |Animated zoom of phone numbers
|===

=== Direct call via telephony system

The user may configure one or more telephone numbers under 'My account'.
Afterwards he is able to initiate phone calls directly from
ProjectForge® if configured by the administrators and supported by
the telephony system. Figure  +
17 demonstrates the possibility to initiate a phone call directly from
ProjectForge®.

image::/uploads/userguide/Direktwahl-Adressbuch.png[image]


[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 17: |shows the auto-completion functionality to initiate phone
calls very easy.
|===

**Hint**

____
Please use the 'return' key for initiating the phone call. Like on most
pages the 'return' key result in the default action.
____

==== Configuration

Please add your personal phone number (or a list of phone number) under
'My account'.

== Structure elements in ProjectForge (former tasks)

The term 'structure element' is used in a generic way and represents
customers, projects, releases, structure elements etc. They're organized
hierarchical. Access rights may depend on structure elements (and are
derived from ancestor structure elements if configured). Figure 19 shows
a typical tree view of structure elements in ProjectForge®.

image::/uploads/userguide/TaskTree.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 19: |Hierarchy of structure elements in ProjectForge®
|===

The following table describes the fields of structure elements:

[cols="1,3",]
|===
|Field |Description

|Parent structure element |The structure element is a descendant
structure element of the parent structure element. The structure
elements at the top of the hierarchy is the root node which is the
onliest structure element without a parent structure element.

|Name |

|Referenz |Multi purpose field, optional. This field is derived for all
descendant structure elements if not overwritten in such structure
elements. This is useful for exports etc.

|Status |

|Priority |

|Short description |

|Description |

|Progress |optional without further functionality.

|Maximum hours |If given, the consumption will be displayed in the
structure tree as well as during booking a time sheet, see 5.1 .

|Responsible |ProjectForge®-User for information

|Cost2 |All cost2 values are project specific if a project was assigned
to this structure element or any ancestor structure element. The black
list defines cost 2 entries which should be excluded of the assigned
project. If no project is assigned, cost 2 value are configurable by
using a white list.

|Protect time sheets until |If set, only time sheets with start dates
after the given date may-be inserted and updated. Members of the
financial staff are able to insert, update and delete older time-sheets
of other users (not own time sheets).

|Protection of privacy |If checked the time sheets of this structure
element and any descendent structure elements are invisible for other
users (except the members of the financial staff).
|===

=== Consumption

Consumptions are displayed as part of the structure tree as well as
during every booking process of time sheets. The consumption of already
used hours of a structure element including all structure sub elements
is displayed as a tool tip.

==== Consumption bars for open structure elements

[cols="1,3,3",]
|===
|Color |Meaning |Tool tip

| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-empty.png[image, width=100]
|No budget given |Total consumption in man-days.

| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-green.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption 0-80% |Total consumption in man-days and percent, green
bar.

| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-yellow.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption 80%-90% |Total consumption in man-days and percent.

| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-orange.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption 90%-100% |Total consumption in man-days and percent.

| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-orange-red.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption over 100% |Total consumption in man-days and percent.
|===

==== Consumption bars for finished structure elements

[cols="1,3,3",]
|===
|Color |Meaning |Tool tip
| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-empty.png[image, width=100]
|No budget given |Total consumption in man-days.
| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-green.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption 0-100% |Total consumption in man-days and percent.
| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-red.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption 100%-110% |Total consumption in man-days and percent.
| image:/uploads/userguide/Consumption-orange-red.png[image, width=100]
|Consumption über 110% |Total consumption in man-days and percent.
|===

==== Suppressing the status of consumption bars

Enter 0 as maximum hours of a structure element for suppressing the
status (color and percentage) of a consumption bar. This is use-ful for
not demotivating a team or if not all orders with budgets are assigned
to a structure element.

=== Booking of time sheets

Time sheets must be assigned to a structure element. For improving the
quality of time sheets different rules may be defined in
ProjectForge®.  +
Following rules are implemented, if the user doesn't hit the rules he
won't be able to book his working time on such structure elements.

. The user needs the access to this structure element or any ancestor
structure element including the right of booking time sheets.
. The structure element or any ancestor structure element may not have a
time-protection setting. The users will not be able to modify or add
time sheets for a day before time-protection (date field).
. The structure element or any ancestor structure element is closed or
deleted.
. The booking status of a structure element or any ancestor structure
element is 'completely closed'.
. If the structure element is not a structure leaf element (has
descendents) and the booking status is configured as 'only leaf nodes'.
. If any descendent structure element has an assigned order. This rule
is important because otherwise ProjectForge® won't be able to
calculate the consumption of budgets defined by orders.

If a structure element is closed for booking of time sheets the user may
modify fields not affecting financial parameters (such as description
but not times, duration, cost settings etc.) The user may therefore
correct typos etc. in time sheets.

== Order book

Offers and orders may be managed by ProjectForge®. The may-be
assigned to project managers having access to their orders and offers.
Administrative staff members may have access to all orders if they have
the right to do (see user administration of ProjectForge®).

=== E-mail notification

All modifications of orders, if not done by the project manager itself
will be sent by e-mail including a quick link to the order, see figure
20, a notification is suppressed if the check-box is disabled..

image::/uploads/userguide/Auftragsbuch-Notification.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 20: |Order book with e-mail notification
|===

== Scripting in ProjectForge®

You may edit, store and execute scripts in ProjectForge for generating
Excel files out of the database of ProjectForge® as well as charts
etc. It's also possible to upload Excel master file to scripts for
modifiing existing Excel files.  +
A script editor is built-in in ProjectForge®.

=== Examples

You may use some predefined scripts for getting an idea how powerful the scripting
in ProjectForge® is.

==== Example: Easy Excel-file generation

[source,kotlin,linenums]
----
// Simple otlin script
val users = userDao.getList()
val workbook = ExcelUtils.prepareWorkbook("Userlist.xlsx")
val sheet = workbook.createOrGetSheet("Users")
sheet.registerColumns(
  "Username|20", // Title Username is also property name, length = 20
  "Full name|fullname|30", // Title differs from property name
  "Email|30",
  "Id|10|:integer",
  "Description|50",
)
sheet.createRow().fillHeadRow()
users.forEach { user ->
  val row = sheet.createRow()
  ExcelUtils.autoFill(row, user)
}
sheet.setAutoFilter() // optional Excel auto filter
workbook
----

==== Example: Usage of ProjectForge® filters

[source,kotlin,linenums]
----
val filter = TimesheetFilter()
filter.startTime = PFDateTime.withDate(2022, Month.JANUARY, 1).utilDate
filter.stopTime = PFDateTime.withDate(2022, Month.JUNE, 30).utilDate
val list = timesheetDao.getList(filter)

"Number of found time sheets: ${list?.size}"
----

PFDateTime and PFDay uses automatically the time zone of the current logged-in
user as default.


=== Access rights (DAOs)

You may access all database entries by using the DAOs
(DataAccessObjects) of ProjectForge®. The DAOs ensures that only
such entities are returned for those the user has access to. All
entities without the user's access are removed by the DAOs of the result
lists.


=== Creation of diagrams and charts

You may create charts using (www.jfree.org).

image::/uploads/userguide/ExportJFreeChart.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 21: |Example of a script producing a chart
|===

[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.jfree.chart.*
import org.jfree.chart.plot.*
import org.jfree.data.general.*
import org.jfree.util.*
import org.projectforge.excel.*

DefaultPieDataset dataset = new DefaultPieDataset()
dataset.setValue("Linux", 15)
dataset.setValue("Mac", 8)
dataset.setValue("Windows", 70)
dataset.setValue("Others", 7)
JFreeChart chart = ChartFactory.createPieChart3D("Users on www.heise.de", dataset, true, true, false)
PiePlot3D plot = (PiePlot3D) chart.getPlot()

ExportJFreeChart export = new ExportJFreeChart(chart, 800, 600)
return export
----

=== Creation of zip archives containing multiple files

You may create zip files containing multiple files (Excel sheets and
diagrams).

[source,java,linenums]
----
import ...
ExportZipArchive zip = new ExportZipArchive("my-first-archive") // File name will be: my-first-archive.zip
ExportWorkbook workbook = new ExportWorkbook(...)
zip.add("sheet.xls", workbook)
ExportJFreeChart chart = new ExportJFreeChart(...)
zip.add("chart.jpg", chart)
return zip
----

=== Nested and indexed properties

You may use bean properties using the common used notation:

[source,java,linenums]
----
sheet.propertyNames = ["user.username", "description", "startTime", "stopTime", +
         "kost2.kost2Art.fakturiert"]
----

as well as indexed properties (such as the property username of the
user).  +
Nested and indexed properties are supported as
well: `users[3].name` or `result.userList[0].`

=== Import of Excel files

Figure 22 shows an example file.

image::/uploads/userguide/Excel-import-example.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 22: |Example file for an Excel import
|===

[source,java,linenums]
----
import java.text.*;
import org.projectforge.excel.*
NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.UK);

xls = reportScriptingStorage.getFile("import-example.xls") // Was uploaded with this name.
ExportWorkbook workbook = new ExportWorkbook(xls);// Use script.file instead of xls in script list.
ExportSheet sheet = workbook.getSheet("Sheet-1"); // Gets sheet with the given title.
rows = sheet.rows; // Get all rows.
result = "";
total = 0.0;

for (int i = 1; i < sheet.rows.size; i++) {
  row = sheet.getRow(i);
  no = row.getCell(0).getNumericCellValue();
  name = row.getCell(1).getStringCellValue();
  amount = row.getCell(2).getNumericCellValue();
  total += amount;
  result += (int)no + ". The amount of " + name + " is: " + nf.format(amount) + "\n";
}
result += "The total amount is: " + nf.format(total);
return result;
----

The output is:

[source,linenums,shell]
----
 The amount of Susan is: £50.23
 The amount of Hugo is: £17.00
 The amount of Lisa is: £15.00
 The amount of Mona is: £10.00
The total amount is: £92.23
----

== Financial administration with ProjectForge®

=== Invoices

ProjectForge® supports the management of invoices (inbound and
outbound, creditors and debitors):

* Inovices may contain an unlimited number of positions.
* If the cost-module is configured you may assign the amount to one or
an unlimited number of cost units (as amount or as percent).

==== Assignment of cost units

It's recommended to try this feature for a better understanding.  +
You may assign positions of invoices to cost1 and cost2 units. An
autocomplete functionality helps you to distribute the amounts to cost
units very fast. You may enter numbers of cost units as well as text (e.
g. text fields of a cost unit such as description. customer, type
etc.).  +
An unlimitited number of assignments are supported. After adding new
assignments ProjectForge® prefills the amount of the invoice which
wasn't assigned yet. The amount may be given as amount or as percent
value.  +
For better tracebility you may not delete positions (after stored in the
database). If an entry should be removed, enter '0' as amount.

==== Clone functionality for invoices (inbound and outbound)

You may clone existing invoices for a faster process of inserting new
invoices:

* The date will be replaced by 'today'.
* The positions as well as any existing assignment to cost units will be
copied.

=== Liquidity planning / forecast

Based on invoices and additional liquidity entries (others than
invoices) ProjectForge® gives you the opportunity to manage your
cash flow very easy including a forecast of your cash flow.

==== Calculation of expected dates of payments

ProjectForge® uses due dates for forecasting the cash flow and
account balance. For invoices ProjectForge® calculates the expected
dates of payment based on already paid invoices in the last 12 month of
the same:

. Project: Do paid invoices already exist for the same project?
. Customer number: Do paid invoices already exist for the customer
(given by the cost number)?
. Customer text: Do paid invoices already exist for the customer (full
text)?
. Customer short text: Do paid invoices already exist for the customer
(the beginning of the customer text will be used)?

If any paid invoice was found (starting with project) a mean time of
payment of the paid invoices is used for calculating the expected date
of payment.

=== Datev-Import (German)

Über diese Funktion werden die Konten (Kontenplan) und die Buchungssätze
eingelesen. Diese Daten werden vom Steuerbüro in Form eines
Excel-Exports geliefert.

==== Grundsätzliches zum ProjectForge®-Excel-Import

* ProjectForge® liest Tabellenblätter mit bestimmten Namen bzw.
Namensmustern ein. Tabellenblätter, deren Namen ProjectForge® im
Import nicht unterstützt, werden ignoriert.
* ProjectForge® erkennt die Werte in den Spalten anhand des Namens
der Kopfspalte
* Die Reihenfolge der Spalten ist variabel.
* Es können zusätzliche Spalten enthalten sein. Diese Spalten werden
ignoriert.
* Die Importdaten werden im Import-Storage innerhalb der Benutzersitzung
gespeichert. Der Anwender kann beliebige Schritte innerhalb seiner
Benutzersitzung durchführen, ohne dass die Importdaten verloren gehen.
Auch die Reihenfolge beim Import von mehreren Tabellenblättern
(Verproben, Prüfen, Selektieren, Speichern etc.) ist beliebig.
ProjectForge® stellt sicher, dass nur fehlerfreie und verprobte
Datensätze importiert werden können.
* Die Übernahme von Daten kann auch schrittweise erfolgen (s. Beispiel
unten: Schritt 3 bis 5 können beliebig oft wiederholt werden, solange
noch nicht alle Daten auch in ProjectForge® nicht übernommen
wurden.)

Im folgenden wird anhand des Kontenplans der Import und die notwendigen
Prüfschritte erläutert.

===== Schritt 1: Auswahl der zu importierenden Excel-Datei

* Figure 24 zeigt den ersten Schritt: Es wird die zu importierende
Excel-Datei über den Browserknopf "Datei auswählen" im lokalen
Dateisystem selektiert. Anschließend wird die gewünschte Importfunktion
(z. B. "Import Kontenplan") gewählt.

|===
|Figure 24: |Datev-Import, Schritt 1: Auswahl der Importdatei
|===

===== Schritt 2: Daten werden eingelesen

* Figure 25 zeigt den zweiten Schritt: Die Daten wurden erfolgreich
eingelesen und die importierten Tabellenblätter (Sheets) untereinander
angezeigt (standardmäßig sind alle Blätter zugeklappt). Im Fehlerfalle
wird der Fehler mit Tabellenblatt, Zeilennummer und Spaltennummer
angezeigt (z. B. wenn ein nicht passendes Zahlenformat in einer Zelle
erkannt wurde.) Fehlerhafte Datensätze können bereits eingesehen werden
(durch Aufklappen des Importbereichs).

|Figure 25: |Datev-Import, Schritt 2: Einlesen der Datei
|===

===== Schritt 3: Verproben

* Figure 26 zeigt den zweiten Schritt: Die Daten wurden erfolgreich
eingelesen und die importierten Tabellenblätter (Sheets) untereinander
angezeigt (standardmäßig sind alle Blätter zugeklappt). Nun sollte die
Funktion "Verproben" für das gewünschte Tabellenblatt / die gewünschten
Tabellenblätter gewählt werden.  +
Beim Verproben gleicht ProjectForge® die importierten Datensätze mit
evtl. bereits vorhandenen Datensätzen ab. Nach dem Verproben werden auch
neue und modifizierte Datensätze angezeigt.

|===
|Figure 26: |Datev-Import, Schritt 3: Verproben
|===

===== Schritt 3: VerprobenPrüfen, selektieren und Übernahme

* Figure 27 zeigt den vierten Schritt: Nach der Verprobung können nun
die zu speichernden Datensätze einer Sichtprüfung unterzogen werden. Bei
modifizierten Einträgen wird über einen Tool tip der ursprüngliche Wert
angezeigt. +
Nach der Prüfung können die Datensätze selektiert werden, die in
ProjectForge® übernommen werden sollen. Mit der Funktion "Select
all" können auch alle angezeigten Datensätze markiert werden.
Anschließend kann über "Commit" eine Übernahme bestätigt und angestoßen
werden.

|Figure 27:__ |_Datev-Import, Schritt 4: Prüfen, Selektion und
Übernahme_
|===

===== Schritt 5: Import abgeschlossen

* Figure 28 zeigt den fünften Schritt: Nach dem Import wird angezeigt,
wieviel Datensätze übernommen wurden. Ein abschließendes "Verproben"
sollte aufgerufen werden. Wenn alle Änderungen erfolgreich übernommen
wurden und alle Datensätze selektiert worden waren, so müsste
abschließend für das Tabellenblatt "nichts zu tun" angezeigt werden.
Wurde nur ein Teilsatz der Daten selektiert, so werden die übrigen noch
zur Auswahl angeboten.

|Figure 28: |Datev-Import, Schritt 5: Abschluss
|===

==== Import der Buchungskonten (Kontenplan)

Für den Import der Buchungskonten wird im zu importierenden
Exceldokument ein Tabellenreiter mit dem Namen "Kontenplan" erwartet.
Dieses Tabellenblatt wird für den Import verwendet. Alle anderen
Tabellenblätter werden ignoriert.

===== Format

Folgendes Format wird erwartet (see figure 29).

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 29: |Excelformat für Datev-Import des Kontenplans
|===

In Zeile 2 wird die Kopfspalte mit den Namen "Konto" und "Bezeichnung"
erwartet. Vorhandene Konten werden nicht gelöscht, sondern bei
Vorhandensein modifiziert.

==== Import der Buchungssätze (01-12)

Für den Import der Buchungssätze werden im zu importierenden
Exceldokument die Tabellenblätter mit dem Namen "01", "02", ..., "12"
berücksichtigt. Diese Blätter stehen für die zu importierenden
Buchungsmonate.

* Beim Import werden die Buchungssätze unabhängig vom Datum dem
Buchungsmonat zugeordnet.
* Datumsangaben von Buchungssätzen dürfen nicht in der Zukunft bezüglich
des Buchungsmonats liegen.
* Das Kalenderjahr zum Buchungsmonat erkennt ProjectForge®
automatisch anhand des Datums der Buchungssätze.
* Die Spalte "Kostenstelle/-träger" wird als "Kost2" interpretiert.
Alternativ kann diese Spalte auch in "Kost2" umbenannt werden.
* Die Spalte "Alt.-Kst." wird "Kost1" interpretiert. Alternativ kann
diese Spalte auch in "Kost1" umbenannt werden.
* Die Spalten "SH" tauchen Datev-bedingt doppelt auf. Die Reihenfolge
darf nicht vertauscht werden, da die erste Spalte "SH" für die Übernahme
"Soll/Haben" verwendet wird.
* Die Spalte Bemerkung ist optional. Hier können Zusatzinformationen,
Hinweise oder Marker zu einzelnen Zeilen angegeben werden.

===== Format

Folgendes Format wird erwartet (see figure 30).

erwartet. Vorhandene Konten werden nicht gelöscht, sondern bei
Vorhandensein modifiziert.

=== Other imports

==== Salaries of employees

The following Excel format is assumed:

. A monthly sheet has the title of format 'yyyy-mm', e. g. "2009-05".
. The columns are:
.. Cost1 unit of the employee, e. g. '3.050.00.00'
.. Employee: Last name, surname
.. Gross salary including taxes and insurance, e. g. '1,846.77'
.. bonus, royalty, overtime premium etc. as decimal value
.. Special payment as decimal value
.. Car as decimal value
.. Total will be ignored
.. Comment as text field

The following script generates the database SQL-Statement for importing
the salaries:

[source,java,linenums]

  }
}
return result;
----

=== Time sheets

==== Protection

You may protect time sheets by date for structure elements (including
all descendent structure elements). This protection ensures that no
employee is able to modify time sheets with dates before the date where
the protection ends.  +
This is useful if the time sheets are invoiced or taken over by other
accounting systems. Figure 31 shows a structure element with a
protection of time sheets until 30/06/2013.  +
Time sheets with dates before the date of protection may only be changed
by members of the financial administration staff (regarding times and
cost assignements).

image::/uploads/userguide/Zeitberichtsschutz.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 31: |Time sheet protection for structure elements (incl.
structure sub elements)
|===

==== Cost units

* You may assign projects and/or cost2 units to a structure element.
* If a project is assigned, all existing cost2 units of this projects
are automatically assigned to this structure element.
* If there is now project or cost unit assigned to a structure element,
all settings of the parent structure element are used. If no such
setting found for the parent element the grand parent element is used
and so on.
* Only such cost units are used which have no status value or the status
value 'ACTIVE'.

If there is any cost2 unit associated with a structure element (directly
or derived), an user has to select a suitable cost unit while booking
time sheets. +
Figure 32 shows a structure element with the assigned project '5.200.00
- ProjectForge®' and the cost unit '5.200.00.*'.

|===
|Figure 32: |Assigning cost2 units to structure elements.
|===

**Hint**

____
If you are missing cost units you may add them via project edit page
(with status 'ACTIVE').  +
If you want to disable cost units you may change the status of such
units to 'INACTIVE' or 'ENDED' or you may remove them by using the
black- or white list (see fig. ref label="fig:aufgabeKost2" type="full"
/>).
____

==== Booking of time sheets

For time sheets assigned to structure elements with assigned cost units
a selection of a cost unit is required as shown in figure 33.

image::/uploads/userguide/Zeitbericht_anlegen_kost2.png[image]


[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 33: |Booking of time sheets to structure elements with given
cost units
|===

==== Monthly employee reports

A monthly employee report for users with all time sheets ordered by cost
units, structure element, user and weeks are also available as PDF for
download. These reports may me used for e. g. signing monthly reports of
employees by their managers.



==== JIRA support

JIRA issues are supported if configured. If JIRA issues are contained in
e. g. time sheets or description of structure elements then the will be
displayed with links to the configured JIRA system.

=== Cost unit accounting

==== Fraction of working time

You may configure a fraction for single cost units or cost unit types
(default is 1). Example: if the travelling time should be counted only
as half regarding the employees working time, you may configure the
fraction as 0,5.



=== Reporting via Report objectives (in progress)

. If an include list is empty, all records will match for this include
list (wildcard).
. If an include list isn't empty, at least one entry must match.
. For multiple include lists a record must match all include lists
(logical 'and').
. If a record matches at least one entry of any exclude list, this
record will be excluded.

The method `String.matches(regExp)` is used for evaluating the regular
expressions. You may refer the expression syntax of the Java
class `java.util.regex.Pattern` for a better understanding. For your
convenience ProjectForge® modifies automatically the configured
expressions before usage: All points ('.') will be escaped and the
wildcard character '*' is replaced by '.*'. You may suppress the
automatical modification by prepending an apostrophe, e. g. "'^5\.510.*"
will not be modified (only the apostrophe itself is removed before
evaluation).  +
Examples:

* +++"3.*"+++ -> +++"3\..*"+++ (matches all strings beginning with "3.".
* +++"*.02"+++ -> +++".*.02"+++ (matches all strings ending with ".02".
* +++"'^5.02.*"+++ -> +++"^5.02.*"+++ (matches all strings starting with "5?02".

(This strategy of replacement is for convenience purposes because '.'
means normally any character and '*' means a multiple occurrence of the
character before the asterisk: for example "3.1*" will match "3x1111"
but not "3.120.08.02".)

**Hint**

____
A child ReportObjective may only consist of entries of the parent
ReportObjective (only a subset)!

== Data protection

=== Passwords

Passwords will be stored SHA-encrypted in the database. Directly after
usage of passwords (such as in the login screen) all password variables
will be deleted. Passwords are not part of any log file entry.



=== History of changes

All modifications of entities (create, update, delete) are stored with
time stamp, user who cause the modification and the modified fields with
the old and new value. The history of changes is displayed at the edit
page of an entity. There are single special fields which are not part of
this history mechanism.



=== Logging

Access violations and actions of users (such as modification of
entities) as well as any error message are stored in log files. The log
file is important for analyzing error etc.



=== Phone call - numbers

Every phone call will be logged. A log file entry contains:

. User causes the phone call
. Source phone number
. Destination phone number without the last 3 digits, eg 012345xxx.

== Glossary

The developers of ProjectForge® were using the German language until
several years ago for some financial terms. Nowadays English is the main
language of the development (for Java classes, documentation etc.). Here
you may find translation and description of common used terms.

[cols="1,1,3",]
|===
|German |English |Description

|Aufgabe |task |Since mid of 2013 the term task was replaced by
'structure elements' because such elements may represent not only tasks,
they represent customers, projects, releases, tasks etc.

|Auftrag |order |

|Beleg |receipt |

|Betrag |amount |

|Brutto |gross (amount) |

|Buchungssatz |accounting records |Accounting records are entities which
are imported by external financial systems (e. g. DATEV in Germany). The
recommended workflow is to organize invoices, salaries of the employees
etc. with ProjectForge® and then to import the data in the external
financial system. The re-imported accounting records should match the
data in ProjectForge. +
ProjectForge® and the scripts also work if you don't have accounting
records, you may use the origin entities such as invoices etc. directly
in your scripts. +
The plural of accounting record is: Buchungssaetze

|BWA |business assessment |Term used inside the financial module of
ProjectForge®.

|DATEV |  |Software common used in Germany for financial administration.
ProjectForge® offers import and export interfaces.

|Datum |date |

|Eingangsrechnung |invoice |Used for incoming invoices (creditors).

|fakturiert |invoiced |

|Fibu |financial administration |Fibu is the abbreviation of the German
term 'Finanzbuchhaltung'.

|Gegenkonto |contra account |Term used inside the financial module of
ProjectForge®.

|Kontenplan |account structure |Term used inside the financial module of
ProjectForge®.

|Konto |account |Term used inside the financial module of ProjectForge®.

|Kost |cost |Term used inside the financial module of ProjectForge®.
Kost1/Kost2 -> cost1/cost2 is the short form of 'cost unit'.

|Kostenträger |cost unit |Term used inside the financial module of
ProjectForge®.

|Kostenträgerart |type of cost unit |Term used inside the financial
module of ProjectForge®. Examples for types of cost units are:
'Travelling', 'Acquisition', 'Meetings' etc. Types are customizable and
used for specifying different types of costs in projects and/or company
wide.

|Kostenzuweisung |cost assignment |Term used inside the financial module
of ProjectForge®. Costs, such as employee salaries, position of invoices
(incoming and outgoing) etc. are assigned to cost units.

|Kunde |customer |

|Menge |amount |

|Netto |net (amount) |

|Projekt |project |

|Rechnung |invoice |Used for outgoing invoices (debitors).
