== Express installation
You may choose now between Docker based installation or normal installation.

Or, as a developer, you may also refer https://github.com/micromata/projectforge/[ProjectForge on GitHub].

=== Docker
You may install ProjectForge as docker image. You may run ProjectForge as docker image since version 8.0
on Linux (amd64 and arm64) as well as on MacOS (Intel or Silicon).

We assume `/home/projectforge/ProjectForge` as ProjectForge's home in this documentation, but you may choose anything else (will be created or should be empty if already exists).

For test or small installations you may use the built-in database (embedded).

==== Running single docker container

1. First start `docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v $HOME/ProjectForge:/ProjectForge --name projectforge micromata/projectforge`
2. Follow setup wizard below.
3. Enjoy.
4. Stop ProjectForge by pressing `CTRL-C` or `docker stop projectforge`.

You may monitor the log file: `tail -f ~/ProjectForge/logs/ProjectForge.log`

To stop and start use `docker start/stop projectforge`.

For full functionality of all plugins, you should restart the docker container:

1. `docker stop projectforge`
2. `docker start projectforge`

==== Running as stack (docker-compose)

In this docker-compose case ProjectForge is composed with a PostgreSQL docker container (for productive and larger installations).

1. Copy and modify https://github.com/micromata/projectforge/blob/master/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml] (change data base password).
2. First start: `docker-compose run projectforge-app`
3. Follow setup wizard below (choose PostgreSQL connection settings).
4. Enjoy.

To stop and start user `docker-compose up/down`.

You may monitor the log file: `tail -f ~/ProjectForge/logs/ProjectForge.log`

For configuring ProjectForge, go to ProjectForge base dir:
1. `projectforge.properties` for customizing settings of ProjectForge.
2. `environment.sh` for customizing settings of Java options (increasing memory size etc.).

=== Java-Installation (without docker)
If you don't want to use Docker, you're able to install ProjectForge from the executable jar file.

1. Install openjdk 17.
2. Get projectForge-application_version.jar
3. First start: java -jar projectForge-application_version.jar

Here you will find the supported versions of Java: <<Supported Java versions>>

=== The installation setup wizard (for all installations)
After first start, you'll be asked for entering the setup wizard. Go for it.
There is an console setup wizard available as well as a graphical wizard as desktop application, depending on your environment. You may choose
the version if your system supports both (graphical output and terminal output).

Both editions have the same functionality.

=== Activation of built-in-plugins


[#img-admin-plugins]
.You have to activate some built-in plugins if you want to use them. The plugin "Data transfer" is recommended.
[link=/uploads/admin-plugins.png]
image::/uploads/admin-plugins.png[Activation of built-in plugins (Menu Administration -> Plugins),400]


== Customization

=== Main configuration file `projectforge.properties`

You'll find an overview of all configuration options here: https://github.com/micromata/projectforge/blob/master/projectforge-business/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]

A minimal set of `projectforge.properties` will be installed automatically by the setup wizard.

Here you may define your company logo.

=== Configuration parameters

You'll find further configuration params through the web application under the menu 'Administration' -> 'Configuration'.

=== Special configurations, file `config.xml`

A minimal set of `config.xml` will be installed automatically by the setup wizard. Here you may define your specific holidays.

== Secure http connection (SSL/https)

The recommended way of setting up ProjectForge is to use a reverse proxy to do the SSL termination.

There are different ways to do so.

=== Using built-in functionality

Without nginx, Apache etc. you may use the ProjectForge's built-in functionalities, see e. g. https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-https-self-signed-certificate

=== Nginx

==== Prepare

All of the commands below should be run with `root` privileges.

1. Install Nginx: `$ apt-get install nginx`
2. Get an SSL certificate(use only one of the options below)
   a. Create self signed certificate: `$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/projectforge.key -out /etc/ssl/projectforge.crt`
   b. Generate an SSL certificate https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/[using Letsencrypt], note that the path in the NGINX configuration below needs to be changed when using Letsencrypt.
3. Generate secure Diffie-Hellman parameters for key exchange (this will take a long time): `$ openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096`

===== secure domain for setup through htpasswd (optional)
1. `$ apt-get install apache2-utils`
2. `$ htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd projectforge`

==== Configure Nginx

To use NGINX as a reverse proxy, it's necessary to create a configuration file. The standard path for NGINX configurations is `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`, so let's create the file link:misc/nginx_sites-available_projectforge[`/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectforge`].
If you want to use `.htaccess` to block access to the installation, you need to remove the comment character (`#`) in front of the `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_file` parameters.
If you want to use HSTS (which makes browsers show an error page when the SSL certificate is invalid and/or nonexistent), remove the comment character (`#`) in front of the `add_header Strict-Transport-Security` parameter.

**Remember to replace *projectforge.example.com* with the actual domain you'll run ProjectForge on!**


To activate the NGINX configuration, you'll need to symlink the configuration file we just created to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. This can be done by using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ln -sv /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectforge /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/projectforge
----

=== Apache httpd
to be defined.

== Using CardDAV and WebDAV with Milton
Place files `milton.license.properties` and `milton.license.sig` to directory `~/ProjectForge/resources/milton/` and start ProjectForge with
loader path:

[source,bash]
----
${JAVA} ... -Dloader.path=${HOME}/ProjectForge/resources/milton ${DEBUGOPTS} -jar projectforge-application.jar &
----

== Start ProjectForge (without docker)
1. Start ProjectForge server (e.g. on `http://localhost:8080`, update the NGINX config if you use another port).
2. Follow the configuration instruction (setup wizard in console ui or as Desktop app).
3. (Re-)start Nginx:
3.1. SysVInit: `/etc/init.d/nginx restart`
3.2. SystemD: `systemctl restart nginx`
4. Navigate to ProjectForge with your browser and finalize the setup.

* Example start script: link:/uploads/startProjectForge.sh[startProjectForge.sh]
* Example stop script: link:/uploads/stopProjectForge.sh[stopProjectForge.sh]

== Adding external plugins
ProjectForge supports external 3rd party plugins:
1. Place your jars e. g. in `/home/kai/ProjectForge/plugins`
2. Tell ProjectForge where it is. You may have to options:
a. Run ProjectForge from command line with option `-Dloader.home=/home/kai/ProjectForge`, or
b. Set the environment variable before starting ProjectForge: `export LOADER_HOME=/home/kai/ProjectForge`.
3. Start ProjectForge and activate the plugin as admin in the ProjectForge's web app under menu Admin->plugins.
4. Restart ProjectForge.

== Backups
=== JCR
Attachments will be handled through the built-in JCR module. The backups are placed in `ProjectForge/backup`, the daily backups will
purged after 30 days keeping each first monthly backup.


=== DB backup
You may configure a purge job in `projectforge.properties`:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
### If purgeBackupDir is given and exists, ProjectForge will purge daily backups older than 30 days keeping each first monthly backup.
### The filenames must contain the date in ISO format (...yyyy-MM-dd....).
# This is the backup dir to look for:
projectforge.cron.purgeBackupDir=/home/projectforge/backup
# You may optional specify the prefix of the backup files (if not given, all files containing a date in its filename will be processed):
projectforge.cron.purgeBackupFilesPrefix=projectforge_
----
Your daily data base backups should contain the date of backup in ISO format in its file name.
Daily backups (not monthly) will be deleted after 30 days.
Refer config file for all options: [https://github.com/micromata/projectforge/blob/develop/projectforge-business/src/main/resources/application.properties]
